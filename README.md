- Web server configuration (Nginx/Apache)
- SSL/TLS setup
- Security hardening
- Monitoring and maintenance

## üìã Usage

### Creating a Sync Job
1. **Select Source Files**
   - Use the file browser to navigate
   - Check files and directories to include
   - Switch between single and multi-path selection modes

2. **Configure Destination**
   - Set S3 bucket path (preserves directory structure)
   - Choose overwrite behavior for existing files

3. **Schedule or Run**
   - Run immediately
